  <h2>The Oakland Athletics are my favorite MLB team</h2>
  <p class="headings">Here are some of the reasons why they are my favorite team:</p>
    <ul class="bold">
      <li>I have gone to games since I was a kid.</li>
      <li>The 2002 "Moneyball" team is one of my best sports memories.
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>That Athletics team set an American League record 20 straight wins, a record that will probably never be broken.</li>
          <li>You can re-live the magic of that year in the 2011 film "Moneyball," featuring Academy Award Winner Jonah Hill.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      <li>I have lived in the Bay Area since 2011 and am surrounded by tons of dedicated fans.</li>
      <li>Their penchant for attracting gritty, nose-to-the-grindstone players makes them fun to watch.
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>This is part of their "Green Collar Baseball" moniker.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>One of my favorite fan sites for Oakland A's news and speculation is <a href="http://www.athleticsnation.com">Athletics Nation.</a></p>
  <p>Looking at the html source page, I can tell this page is much more complex than mine. I see there is a lot of meta data, links, lots of script commands. Much of the "script" commands have the word javascript next to them, which leads me to believe they are javascript commands. A lot of the text looks like the httpbin stuff from forms.</p>
  <p>There is a whole lot more to interact with on the Athletics Nation website, such as links to articles, advertisements, an email sign-up, and the ability to submit comments.</p>
  <p>The bad thing is that the ads are too prominent and get in the way of browsing the web page. Maybe it was part of the marketing deal that the advertisers would get significant space.</p>

<footer>Web page author Jesse Calton has been an A's fan for life. He was but an infant child during their 1989 World Series sweep of the Giants, but does remember falling down and skinning his knees running down the gravel pathways at the Oakland Coliseum circa 1994.</footer>
